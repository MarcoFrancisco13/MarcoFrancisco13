<h3>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I'm Marco Carlos Francisco, a 4th Year student in BS Management Information Systems at Ateneo de Manila University. Throughout my stay here, I have worked on various projects with student organizations such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ateneo.MISA">MISA</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gdscloyola">G-DSC Loyola</a> using various tech stacks, frameworks, and tools. This has helped me foster a love for technology and fueled my desire to pursue a career in Software Enginnering. 

Furthermore, I have had the privilege of entering the professional setting through the two internships that I have taken in startup companies. One of these internships was at <a href="https://www.abakadastudios.com/">Abakada Studios</a> where I worked as a Web Development Intern, handling the creation of web pages for the use of building effective educational systems for the company's clients. My 2nd internship was at <a href="https://www.algar.com.ph/">ALGAR Information Systems</a> where I worked as a Software Engineering Intern, wherein I was trained in the use of Azure Dev Ops, .NET, and Xamarin in creating a mobile version of their existing finance system. Through these experiences, I have further exposed myself to the discipline of the working environment and the soft skills needed to navigate through this. I hope to experience more things in the future to further advance myself as a developer!
